Analyzed data from animal study where 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated though a variety of drug regimens. Analyzed comparison of performance of drug of interest, Capomulin, versus other treatment regimens. 

- cleaned data (removed duplicate mouse IDs)
- generated summary statistics table
- generated bar plot showing total number of measurements taken for each treatment regimen throughout study
- showed distribution of female and male mice using pie plot
- calculated final tumor volume of each mouse across the four most promising treatments
- generated box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for four treatment regimens and highlighted potential outliers
- generated a line pot for mouse treated with Capomulin versus time
- calculated correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for Capomulin treatment
